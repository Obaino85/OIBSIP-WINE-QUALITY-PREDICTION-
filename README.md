# OIBSIP-WINE-QUALITY-PREDICTION-
The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the features for three distinct classifier models.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze and predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical attributes. Using machine learning techniques, we aim to identify key features affecting wine quality and build predictive models to estimate wine quality ratings. This can help winemakers maintain consistency and improve quality control based on measurable chemical properties.

## Key Concepts and Challenges

**Classifier Models:** Utilizing Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for wine quality prediction.

**Chemical Qualities:** Analyzing features like density and acidity as predictors for wine quality.

**Data Analysis Libraries:** Employing Pandas for data manipulation and Numpy for array operations.

**Data Visualization:** Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizing patterns and insights in the dataset.

## Key Insights

- Citric acid, alcohol, and volatile acidity are among the most influential features affecting wine quality.
- Higher alcohol content generally correlates with higher quality ratings.
- Wines with high volatile acidity tend to have lower quality scores.
- Machine learning models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed well in predicting wine quality, with Random Forest providing higher accuracy.
